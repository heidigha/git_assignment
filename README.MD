a. What is an issue?

In GitHub, an issue is a versatile tool for tracking tasks, bugs, feature requests, and other items within a project repository. It serves as a collaborative space where team members can discuss, organize, and manage work, typically including a title, description, labels, assignees, and comments.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request in GitHub is a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bugfix on a branch. It allows other contributors to review the proposed changes, discuss potential modifications, and merge the code into the main branch if approved.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click the "Pull requests" tab.
2. Click the "New pull request" button.
3. Select your branch as the compare branch and the main branch as the base branch.
4. Add a title and description for your pull request, explaining your changes.
5. Review the changes and ensure everything looks correct.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code locally on a developer's machine, allowing for branching, merging, and collaboration without requiring a central server. 
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides a graphical interface and additional collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools. While Git can be used independently, GitHub leverages Git's functionality to create a platform for sharing code, collaborating with others, and managing software projects online.

f. What does git diff do?

Git diff is a command that shows the differences between various Git states.

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch in Git is the primary branch of a repository. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, it's not recommended to push changes directly into the main branch, except for the initial commit in a new repository.
